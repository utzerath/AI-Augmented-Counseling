### My part in this team:
Build a website with Front and Backend Capabilites in order to optimze healthcare

### Purpose
This website optmizes counseling in two different ways. 

First, users can automatically upload their journal entries so that the counselor can see how their patient is doing before they have an in-person session. This will mean that they spend less time catching up, allowing the counselor to focus on the heart of the session.

Secondly, users can take a DUI screening assessment. After one receives a DUI, court-ordered counseling is often the outcome. Judges use this DUI screening assessment in court. This assessment is also given to the counselor, who is able to evaluate this assessment and devise a counseling plan. By scoring and evaluating this assessment automatically, we will eliminate human error in scoring (misinterpretations, miscalculations, ambiguous answers/questions, subjective answers). In addition, the counselor will automatically use this evaluation generated by OpenAI.
